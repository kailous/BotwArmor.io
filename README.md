# Cotera&#46;io

**Cotera&#46;io**, named after the Great Fairy in Kakariko Village, is a
website and web-app designed to help you track your armor upgrades in *The
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and make it easier to remember which
items you need for that next upgrade.

In *Breath of the Wild,* the only way to check which items your armor needs
for its next upgrade is to trek all the way back to the closest Great Fairy:
this is super annoying if you're all the way out in the mountains already
hunting for items. **Cotera&#46;io** aims to solve this grievance!
