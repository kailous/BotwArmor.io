# Cotera&#46;io

Thank you for checking out **Cotera&#46;io**! I made this app as a
passion-project, a resume-filler, and as a tool for myself to use as I complete
my fourth playthrough of *Breath of the Wild*.

I created this app because, as I strove for 100% completion in my most recent
playthrough, I kept finding myself forgetting which items I needed to upgrade my
armor through the final levels.

I often thought to myself, "*wouldn't it be handy to have something I can whip
out on my phone, or leave open on my second monitor to quickly double check what
flower I'm looking for?*" I used a stack of sticky-notes on my desk for a while,
but it quickly became messy as I upgraded my armor and scribbled things off my
notes.

So, as someone trying to get my foot in the door as web developer, I figured
this would be a fun project to throw myself into. I hope you like it!
